[Synchronous consensus protocols](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-11-11-authenticated-synchronous-bft/) tolerating Byzantine failures 
depend on the maximum network delay $\Delta$ for their safety and progress. The delay, $\Delta$ is usually much larger than actual network delay
$\delta$ since $\Delta$ is a pessimistic value. Recent synchronous protocols such as [Sync HotStuff](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-11-12-Sync-HotStuff/) have been
trying to reduce reliance on $\Delta$ as much as possible. However, due to a lower bound, a synchronous consensus protocol must incur at least $1\Delta$ commit latency.

[Thunderella](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-78375-8_1) introduced the notion of 
*optimistic responsiveness* that allows synchronous protocols to commit in $O(\delta)$ time when certain optimistic conditions
are met. The optimistic conditions require an honest leader and $>3n/4$ honest replicas. In general, the protocols following
Thunderalla paradigm include two distinct commit paths: (i) an optimistic fast commit path with a commit latency of $O(\delta)$,
and (ii) a slow synchronous commit path with a commit latency of $O(\Delta)$. The protocol makes an explicit switch between the paths
and replicas must explicitly know which of the commit paths they are in. When optimistic conditions are met, the replicas make an explicit switch to 
the fast path and switch back to the slow path when no progress is seen in the fast path. Each switch incurs a latency of
at least $\Delta$. Sync HotStuff adopted this notion of *optimistic responsiveness* and has fast path commit latency of 
$O(\delta)$ and slow path commit latency of $2\Delta$.
 
While such protocols commit *responsively* during optimistic conditions, an adversary, under minority Byzantine faults,
can attack such a strategy to worsen the commit latency compared to a protocol with a single slow path. For example, when
the protocol is in slow path, the adversary responds promptly and the replicas receive $> 3n/4$ responses thereby triggering
a switch to fast path. Once in the fast path, the adversary stops responding and prevents progress. This forces an
explicit switch to the slow path, incurs switching latency in between and worsens the overall commit latency.

To address these concerns, we present an *optimistically responsive* protocols whose fast path and slow paths are active
simultaneously and requires no explicit switch. Replicas commit responsively when optimistic conditions are met 
and commit synchronously otherwise. Our protocols are optimal in terms of commit latency in both the paths. We justify optimality of
*optimistic responsiveness* with following lower bound:

**Theorem 1**
There does not exist a Byzantine Broadcast protocol that can tolerate *f > n/3* faults and when all messages between
 non-faulty parties arrive instantaneously, achieves the following simultaneously under an honest designated sender:  
(i) (optimistic commit) a commit latency of $O(\delta)$ in the presence of $max(1, n − 2f)$ faults,  
(ii) (synchronous commit) a commit latency of < $2\Delta − O(\delta)$ in the presence of f faults.

The lower bound says that if a Byzantine Broadcast protocol tolerating *f > n/3* corruption has an optimistic (fast) 
commit with latency $O(\delta)$ while still being able to tolerate $max(1, n − 2 f )$ faults, then the synchronous (slow)
 commit should have a latency $\ge 2\Delta − O(\delta)$ when tolerating f faults.

Next, we show an *optimistically responsive* protocol with a matching upper bound.

## OptSync: Optimal Optimistic Responsiveness with $2\Delta$ synchronous latency
OptSync commits responsively with a commit latency of $O(\delta)$ when the leader and $>3n/4$ replicas are honest and commit synchronously with a latency of $2\Delta$.
OptSync works in [steady-state-and-view-change](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-10-15-consensus-for-state-machine-replication/) paradigm with a single leader until an equivocation or no progress is detected.
A view-change protocol is executed to elect a new leader and ensure safety when the current leader fails to make progress.
We present core consensus protocol of OptSync in the steady-state.

1. **Propose.** The leader proposes a command *cmd*.  
2. **Vote.** On receiving the first valid proposal from the leader, a replica broadcasts a *vote* for *cmd* and forwards the leader proposal to all other replicas.  
3. **Commit.**  
  (i) **Responsive Commit.** If a replica receives $\lfloor 3n/4 \rfloor + 1$ *votes* for *cmd* and no equivocating proposals, commit *cmd* immediately. Notify commit to all replicas.    
  (ii) **Synchronous Commit.** If a replica does not detect an equivocation within $2\Delta$ time after voting, commit *cmd*.  
 
A replica commits *responsively* when it receives a *responsive quorum* of votes, i.e., $\lfloor 3n/4 \rfloor + 1$ for *cmd* (*responsive certificate*) and has not detected any equivocation.
Similarly, a replica *r* synchronously commits *cmd* if it does not detect an equivocation within $2\Delta$ time after voting. In this case, replica *r* receives at least a *synchronous quorum* of $f+1$ votes for *cmd* (*synchronous certificate*).
We note that a *responsive quorum* for *cmd* and a *synchronous quorum* for *cmd'* does not necessarily intersect at an honest replica. However, if there exists a *responsive quorum* for *cmd*, *cmd'* cannot be synchronously committed. Below we explain why this is the case.

<p align="center">

</p>

Suppose an honest replica *r* commits *cmd* *responsively* at time *t*. This implies two things (i) no honest replica has voted for a conflicting command *cmd'* before time $t-\Delta$, and (ii) all honest replicas will hear a vote for *cmd* by time $t+\Delta$.
The earliest an honest replica *r'* could have voted for *cmd'* is at time $t'$ such that $t-\Delta \le t' \le t$. Since, replica $r'$ learns *cmd* by time $t+\Delta \le $t' + 2\Delta$, it would not commit *cmd'* synchronously. 
Additionally, since a responsive quorum requires $\lfloor 3n/4 \rfloor + 1$ votes, two responsive quorums intersect at least one honest replica. Thus, no conflicting command could get committed responsively.

The above explanation suffices to argue why two conflicting commands cannot be committed at same log position. Within a state machine replication (SMR) setting,
replicas keep voting and committing new commands by extending on previously proposed commands thus forming a linear chain of commands. As we just saw, there could exist a *responsive certificate* and a *synchronous certificate* for conflicting commands.
As a result, there could be conflicting chains extending from conflicting *responsive* and *synchronous* certificates. We resolve this conflict by proposing a novel chain ranking rule that ranks *responsive certificates* higher than *synchronous certificates*
We refer the readers to our [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/458.pdf) for more details on chain ranking and complete protocol specification.

**Remark** 
In the paper, we also present an *optimal optimistic responsive* protocol with only $\Delta$ synchronous latency. This protocol requires all $n$ replicas to be honest to commit responsively.
Both of the above protocols include a synchronous wait during view-change when the current leader is replaced by a new leader.
Our third protocol presents an optimistically responsive view-change protocol and allows replicas to transition to a higher view with a latency of $O(\delta)$ during optimistic conditions.

This protocol is a joint work with [Ittai](https://research.vmware.com/researchers/ittai-abraham) and [Ling](https://sites.google.com/view/renling). Read more about it [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/458.pdf).
